\section{Implementation}
We implement our abstract interpreter in \emph{Scala} programming language. Scala is a JVM based multi-paradigm language which compiles down to Java class files. Therefore, our tool can run on any machine that has JVM and Z3 installed in it. We use \emph{ScalaZ3}\cite{ScalaZ3}, Scala binding for the \emph{Z3} theorem prover, in our tool for solving constraints. We also require \emph{GMP}, GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library installed in our system as an added dependency for Z3.
\paragraph{Constraint Language: CL}
We came up with a constraint language, CL that can easily interface with Z3 theorem prover. Our constraint language abstract syntax is described in Figure ~\ref{fig:cl}. To prove $\alpha \implies \beta$, we first see whether $\neg(\alpha \implies \beta)$ is satisfiable for any set of assignments of value to variables in $\alpha$ or $\beta$. If it is, we infer that $\alpha \implies \beta$ is false, if not it is true.
