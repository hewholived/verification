We have currently implemented an abstract interpreter that can infer logical qualifiers for all the constructs in \lang with the exception of \textit{while}. 
We are squashing out bugs and testing the analysis for the remaining constructs. 
We still need to work out the abstract semantics for \textit{while}, create a good test benchmark, conduct experiments to get insights on performance and precision of our analysis, and then as a nice to have feature, add integer arrays into our language, so that we can infer and verify more interesting properties.

We believe that the abstract interpretation formulation of inferring logical qualifiers is novel, and is a different take on Liquid Types\cite{Rondon2008}. 
We plan to formalize the abstract interpretation rules and prove soundness and termination.
