\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We have presented a static analysis that infers logical qualifiers for programs written in \lang, that helps us prove interesting assertions in a crafted benchmark. 
This involved framing the abstract domain and computable abstract semantics for the abstract interpreter.
We implemented the tool in Scala, and used Z3 for discharging implications required for the different abstract semantics operations.
Since Z3 does not handle multiplication efficiently, we implemented a simple theory of multiplication for the specific set of logical qualifiers we used in our benchmark programs.

For future work, we would like to extend the language with various interesting features, like procedures, pointers, dynamic memory allocation etc., and experiment with how this affects the analysis.
We would also like to add new types to the language, like strings, booleans, objects etc.
